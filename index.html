<h2>Fun facts</h2>
<h5>Some fun facts about me are that I play the saxophone,guitar,piano,and drums. I am also a "sneaker head" and I love to dress with the trends or with what looks good honestly. Living with a bunch of women makes me kind of a fashionisto, so I know how to dress  and cook and take care of babies. There are a lot of babies in my family like A LOT so it kind of rubs off on me. Oh one more thing that I forgot to tell you, I have a flip phone! Don't even look at me like that; it's the best phone ever!</h5>
